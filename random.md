Two proposals on the same form - one to Billie Holiday and Black women artists, and one to ACT-UP. Also interesting is the fact that you can really see her process, where she adds and corrects as she writes.

With a no-nonsense title and a delivery on every promise, LLE 38 treats Philly icons the same way I see Philadelphians inhabit and speak about their city: with pride, and humor, and a bit of a shrug.

LS40 - beautiful monument to the loss of an empty lot (to development) where people used to walk their dogs. Excerpt: “ At night you could look up and see the sky like a big circle above. Dogs could run free here. The lot is so big -- a whole city block. It felt like you could see the whole curvature of the earth. I think the lot will get developed soon and be gone.”
