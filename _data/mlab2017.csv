Colorful LED lights are embedded all over it. Close to its base are 5 hand cranks of different sizes - some at heights children can use - and easy to turn. As you turn one, some of the lights begin to flicker on.

As the second one is turned, more lights are activated. As each additional crank is turned still more lights come alive - in patterns that multiply their playful effects.

When all 5 are being cranked, the total effect is particularly dramatic, variable, and exuberant. Examples (on the sphere) might be: an image of a turning globe, floating clouds, a waving flag, brilliant //fireworks//, or crazy curlicues. Once activated, it all stays lighted up for a few minutes.

Significance: I believe that the preamble of the Declaration of Independence stands as a promise set forth by our founding fathers, a promise that has yet to come to fruition. It is a promise of a nation capable of providing freedom, equity and opportunity for all. The Declaration of Independence was the touchstone of that promise, but its true legacy can be found in the continual exercise of democracy, self-correction, and progress that exists within American society.

The footprint of the arch site is small enough to allow for construction around it, when that day comes. Overlaying the arch opens up new ideas in 21st century monument making. Ideas include: colorful ceramic tiles and the use of the state's sea; special lighting effects; sculpted art depictions as seen on the walls of the Museum of the Revolutionary; and much more - for this is a monument where art and architecture would truly work together. 

Unlike war memorials, the Keystone State Arch is not about somberness, but rather celebration. Its location is viewed by thousands of visitors daily, and is sure to be a tourist stop and contribute to a new waterfront identity. Funding can come from a multitude of private and public resources, even including souvenirs. 

Out of town planners may not give a damn about defining this stat's rich historical heritage with our own Arc de Triomphe, where Penn's vision was born, but some us do. This Monument Lab will be our last chance to have a monument at Penn's Landing worth of this great space. Once the nearly fifty foot concrete skeletal stfucture is torn down, this promising icon - worth of a world of tourists - will be lost forever. Don't let it happen. 

Add your voice, your art, your texting fingers, your joy at seeing this great arch welcome you to Penn's Landing, even as it welcomes you now. For this memorial arch is long overdue; think of the Gateway in St. Louis, or even the Statue of Liberty in New York. Let us honor the dead as we create this lasting tribute and invest in the future of our great Delaware River waterfront.","Architecture, Art, Culture, History, Philadelphia","Infrastructure, Mural, Space",,Mitchell Gordon,,,,,

Do people understand that monuments (statues) were erected in memory/honor of people who were important at that time? Do people understand the history that elevated people to a place where some felt a monument necessary?

My problem is not with monuments but with our failure to adequately teach the history surrounding a monument, to learn from that history and for individuals to emulate the qualities that allowed those individuals to rise up. Why have monuments if we fail to teach their significance? Or fail to apply lessons learned to our current knowledge to make a better history for us all.

And I think such a place deserves to have a monument for women urban designers. I see it as quotes from the 21st century female urban designers inscribed into the curb along the river.

The project involved high school students partnering with architects and graphic designers to come up with an idea for the use of the hundreds of vacant lots in Philadelphia, specifically in the Kensington area. Winners received $2000 to use on one lot to make their project a reality. My project was called //Tag You're It//, and it was about graffiti. I wanted to turn my lot into a blank white canvas, all walls completely white, the lot completely clean no longer filled with drug needles, broken bottles, overgrown weeds. The lot would be created for ALL local graffiti artists, youth, anyone at all, and they'd be able to graffiti, doodle, marker whatever they wanted on the wall. Too many young artists aren't able to freely express themselves because graffiti isn't considered art. It was given this negative connotation because often these artists have nowhere to put their art without it being considered illegal. I want to change that connotation. Art is expression for each and every individual, and they deserve this free space to express themselves. I was the winner of the project, but the company was put out of business before I could make my project a reality. It's something I will never stop feeling strongly about and I would love to see it happen and begin to change our neighborhoods.","Art, Neighborhoods, Youth","Interactive, Vacant Lot, Graffiti",,,,,,,
