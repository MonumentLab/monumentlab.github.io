I'm asking for help from the City of Philadelphia to help me heal and a whole community.  The city messed up the case so badly they had to bite the bullet which only made us suffer more.

We don't see that well enough today or see what was here before that.  \n\n\n\nAs the museum expanding into the space the library can expand as well.  The Rizzo statue could move to this new museum.  The city would have a notably better role in telling the nation's history +the role + betrayal of native Americans could be presented in a way that would have a chance to occasion some healing.",

Close to its base are 5 hand cranks of different sizes - some at heights children can use - and easy to turn. As you turn one, some of the lights begin to flicker on.\n\nAs the second one is turned, more lights are activated. As each additional crank is turned still more lights come alive - in patterns that multiply their playful effects.\n\nWhen all 5 are being cranked, the total effect is particularly dramatic, variable, and exuberant. Examples (on the sphere) might be: an image of a turning globe, floating clouds, a waving flag, brilliant //fireworks//, or crazy curlicues. Once activated, it all stays lighted up for a few minutes.\n\nIt takes everyone, acting together, to ignite something spectacular.",

The Declaration of Independence was the touchstone of that promise, but its true legacy can be found in the continual exercise of democracy, self-correction, and progress that exists within American society.

Fig 1 is a shadow because of fig 2's more operating in the background and not well known by the community. \n\nFig 2 is the actual volunteer, a representation of national service members, police, EMTs, firefighters and military who give their time to help those in need. The //A// symbol is a symbol of a volunteer program dedicated to national service and poverty alleviation. The form of both figs is gender neutral to demonstrate no one is limited to service.",

In doing so it would remind passerby that civilization was and is possible without so much destruction/devastation of the earth. \n\n-Regarding the form the monument would like, perhaps it would portray a ritual of the first nations people of this land (for example a ritual or gathering of the Lenape tribe). Such a monument could show both the social and environmental constructs of indigenous tribes of this land. \n\n-Not only would the monument educate folks on first nation people it could also be set up on a way that offers additional information or access to additional educational resources on the issues of indigenous justice and/or environmental racism.",

(This fantasy space includes a budget for maintenance + a peace keeper/facilitator to keep anyone from hogging it.) \n\n*The space should include:*\n\n-pillows for lounging on/making forts; outdoor fabrics, can have fun shapes like pretzels, liberty bell; bright colors \n\n-A roof or partial roof (open sides) \n\n-space for displaying art/photos. perhaps a slideshow + projector, perhaps a communal chalk board \n\n-a drinking water tap \n\n-space for passerby to share copies of their favorite recipes + read others' \n\nBasically, I want a giant play kitchen that adults can also play in + pillows \n\n*potential collab. w/ organizations like Vetri Community Partners & their mobile teaching kitchen",

      "transcription" : "The Keystone State Arch is a proposal to transform the colossal base of the former aerial tram project at Penn's Landing into a state memorial dedicated to the area where Pennsylvania took root. here we will honor the people who made the state great and who helped carry the nation to greatness. \n\nThe footprint of the arch site is small enough to allow for construction around it, when that day comes. Overlaying the arch opens up new ideas in 21st century monument making. Ideas include: colorful ceramic tiles and the use of the state's sea; special lighting effects; sculpted art depictions as seen on the walls of the Museum of the Revolutionary; and much more - for this is a monument where art and architecture would truly work together. \n\nUnlike war memorials, the Keystone State Arch is not about somberness, but rather celebration. Its location is viewed by thousands of visitors daily, and is sure to be a tourist stop and contribute to a new waterfront identity. Funding can come from a multitude of private and public resources, even including souvenirs. \n\nOut of town planners may not give a damn about defining this stat's rich historical heritage with our own Arc de Triomphe, where Penn's vision was born, but some us do. This Monument Lab will be our last chance to have a monument at Penn's Landing worth of this great space. Once the nearly fifty foot concrete skeletal stfucture is torn down, this promising icon - worth of a world of tourists - will be lost forever. Don't let it happen. \n\nAdd your voice, your art, your texting fingers, your joy at seeing this great arch welcome you to Penn's Landing, even as it welcomes you now. For this memorial arch is long overdue; think of the Gateway in St. Louis, or even the Statue of Liberty in New York. Let us honor the dead as we create this lasting tribute and invest in the future of our great Delaware River waterfront.",

Do people understand that monuments (statues) were erected in memory/honor of people who were important at that time? Do people understand the history that elevated people to a place where some felt a monument necessary?\n\nMy problem is not with monuments but with our failure to adequately teach the history surrounding a monument, to learn from that history and for individuals to emulate the qualities that allowed those individuals to rise up. Why have monuments if we fail to teach their significance? Or fail to apply lessons learned to our current knowledge to make a better history for us all. \n\n#history has its eyes on you \n\n#who tells your story",

Recently we've seen more female landscape architects/ urban designers making a difference, but the big names in the field are still largely men. the river trail project is a great one resulting from recent movement to make urban space more green, sustainable, and accessible. And I think such a place deserves to have a monument for women urban designers. I see it as quotes from the 21st century female urban designers inscribed into the curb along the river. It's unassuming in a way that people may not notice, but people strolling along it would be fun to read.",

Forty years later, with no progress achieved, Alice Paul's group led a movement that held the majority party, rather than individual politicians responsible. Within 6 years, women won the right to vote and voted in the 1920 presidential election. Alice Paul gained her PhD in political science at the University of Pennsylvania on the topic of the political rights of women in Pennsylvania. After achieving votes for women, Alice Paul launched her campaign for an Equal Rights Amendment in 1923 and campaigned for its passage until her death. She was a Quaker raised in Morristown NJ, and a graduate of Swarthmore University.",

University City sometimes feels like a bubble for students who don't always venture out. Additionally, while Philadelphia has a huge population of college students, only about 25% of Philadelphians graduate from college. The railway bridge near World Cafe Live has a really interesting aesthetic because of how the ivy grows up the sides. I propose to put vine arbors underneath on Walnut Street to make use of this natural decoration and to make the bridge to University City more inviting. This might cause college students to venture and learn more about the city, and invite more citizens into University City to make it feel less like an enclosed place.",

When we are in the streets, resisting capitalism we are creating a monument to humanity and the world we want to create. When Philadelphians are resisting unjust systems to demand education funding, $15 minimum wage, union representation, and an end to police brutality, it is a true monument to free expression of the people.",

Ideally the monument could illuminate similarities, and differences in, people's values, prized possessions, and activities across time. It could offer descriptions of some of the objects and even could be a living monument- the public could add one of thier possessions to an open box.",

People should be informed about things in need of discovery, other than cures for cancer and the common cold. When people study, they conventionally focus on what is known rather than what's not known. While //we don't know what we don't know// might be true, learning abut areas with less expertise or information could be even more important than learning about what do. At the end of their visit, people could write their own ideas for //cracks//.",

The project involved high school students partnering with architects and graphic designers to come up with an idea for the use of the hundreds of vacant lots in Philadelphia, specifically in the Kensington area. Winners received $2000 to use on one lot to make their project a reality. My project was called //Tag You're It//, and it was about graffiti. I wanted to turn my lot into a blank white canvas, all walls completely white, the lot completely clean no longer filled with drug needles, broken bottles, overgrown weeds. The lot would be created for ALL local graffiti artists, youth, anyone at all, and they'd be able to graffiti, doodle, marker whatever they wanted on the wall. Too many young artists aren't able to freely express themselves because graffiti isn't considered art. It was given this negative connotation because often these artists have nowhere to put their art without it being considered illegal. I want to change that connotation. Art is expression for each and every individual, and they deserve this free space to express themselves. I was the winner of the project, but the company was put out of business before I could make my project a reality. It's something I will never stop feeling strongly about and I would love to see it happen and begin to change our neighborhoods.",
